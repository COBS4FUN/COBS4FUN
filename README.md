This repository will host the tools developed and the deliverables produced as part of the COBS4FUN
project. 

COBS4FUN stands for “Compression of Biometric Signals for FUture Networks applications”
and was a cascade call project of the structural project S7 FUN-Media, coordinated by the Politecnico
di Torino (Spoke 4) and funded by the European Union – NextGenerationEU as part of the NRRP
– M4C2, Investment 1.3, program “RESearch and innovation on future Telecommunications systems
and networks, to make Italy more smART” (RESTART), PE00000001.

The research activities within the COBS4FUN project were developed entirely by a research team
at the University of Messina, under the supervision of Prof. Giuseppe Campobello, who acted as the
Principal Investigator.

The main objective of COBS4FUN was to develop new formats and compression techniques for the
efficient encoding and transmission of biometric signals, with a strong emphasis on their applicability
to future network environments, including Metaverse and Digital Twins use cases.
